Analysis of flying insect abundances in relation to temperature, vegetation types and location within Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. This github repository has code and explanation for a ggplot map fortified with GIS shapefile data, and two timeseries: Insect Abundance and Temperature.

This github also includes code for a shiny app that allows one to select insect family and time period and render corresponding plots.
